        <h4>UI / UX</h4>
        <h5>UX Design Agency</h5>
        <p>Kosowwwa Digital Agency is passionate about an intuitive user experience because the user is ultimately the one who is the target. We focus on the wants and needs of the user to create stunning solutions through our experience in Research, Strategy, and Design methodologies.</p><b>Research</b>
        <p>By researching users within the guidelines of their environment, and collecting important information about the user to create a well-informed view of the visual experience. Our in-depth product research grows insights and brings light additional strategies. This ensures ease of use of the design, and reduces the need for expensive re-work before an investment is made in development. Ultimately, our methods enable us to innovate empathetically and remain focused on the user.</p><b>Strategy</b>
        <p>Equipped with our research findings, we are able to plan with our clients the most effective path to get to market. Together, we look beyond the boundaries of thinking in terms of features and functions and launch into considering the real holistic needs of the people who will use the product. We employ a combination of strategy tools that can vary according to specific project and client needs. The result is that we establish meaningful user experience strategies for our clients, success metrics, deliverables, and long-term governance.</p><b>Design</b>
        <p>We create digital experiences for any platform that reflect your brand, vision, and end-user needs. Taking the Research and Strategy findings, we start the iterative design process. Through a variety of collaborative techniques we spark not only the creation of individual screens but also generate a consistent and reusable design language as we progress through interaction and visual design. Throughout all of this, we keep the user at the center of every decision. This allows the synthesis of ideas to encapsulate the entire user experience, beyond a single isolated product interaction, and keep it as a set of actions, perceptions, feelings, and emotions that begins the moment a user wakes up to the moment they go to sleep at night.</p>

        <h5>Responsive Web Design</h5>
        <p>With tablets and smartphones on the rise, nearly half of all internet users access online content from their mobile devices.</p>
        <p>If your website is not optimized to be viewed on mobile devices, then you may be losing customers. We design web sites that can be viewed on desktops as well as mobile devices, or we can take it a step further, and design a dedicated mobile site that your customers can be automatically directed to while on-the-go. To make the website compatible and adapt itself to devices with different resolutions and sizes, the responsive design will play an integral part in developing any web application or site.</p><b>What is responsive web design?</b>
        <p>When a website is designed and developed, the display qualities is rendered to a full screen monitor of a PC, which when viewed on a screen of different size or resolution needs readjustment by the user. To reduce the consequences of losing visitors or prospective clients, web designers and developers have devised a method by using the CSS that will automatically adjust webpage layouts for optimal content display for any screen size or resolution.</p><b>Responsive design for better business performance</b>
        <p>Experts predict mobile browsing will overtake desktop browsing over the next few years. Online businesses are now looking forward to adapting new strategies to render users a feature-rich experience using a responsive design. And since responsive design makes website compatible with devices of almost all sizes, enterprises can attract customers without any technical hindrances.</p><b>Responsive design for SEO</b>
        <p>One single site to maintain means that SEO analysts have to build a single set of links, avoiding extra server load, site speed and maintenance issues. Since search engines does not optimize for search based on devices, the onus is on the SEO to redirect customers to the site to meet their device needs.</p>
